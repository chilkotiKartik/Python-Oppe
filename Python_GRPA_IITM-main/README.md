🐍 IIT Madras Python Course – GRPA Solutions & OPPE Practice
✍️ Curated & Maintained by Kartik Chilkoti
Welcome to a Python programming companion repository created as part of the IIT Madras BS in Data Science course. This project contains well-structured solutions to GRPA assignments and OPPE practice problems, compiled by Kartik Chilkoti to help students and self-learners reinforce concepts, practice ethically, and build strong foundations in Python.

📚 Course Material & Expert Resources
Here’s a curated list of top-quality learning resources that align with the course and extend your Python journey:



🛠️ Practice & Skill Building
📗 Automate the Boring Stuff
A fun and practical approach to Python—work with files, PDFs, and automations.

🧭 Python Roadmap – roadmap.sh
A comprehensive learning path from beginner to advanced with tools, libraries, and career guidance.

💻 HackerRank – 10 Days of Python
Improve logic, prep for exams/interviews, and master challenges in a structured format.

💡 OPPE & Course Strategy – Tips from Kartik
Many students struggle with OPPE and GRPA, with a high percentage failing due to lack of practice and poor strategy. Here’s what helped me succeed:

🔁 Code consistently – Solve GRPA + OPPE + PYQs daily. Avoid passive reading—code actively.

🗂️ Explore the oppe/ and WeekXX/ folders in this repo for real questions and working code.

🧠 Simulate exam conditions – No distractions. Time yourself. Practice under pressure.

🛠️ Use Automate the Boring Stuff to make Python fun and real.

💻 Solve Python puzzles on HackerRank to enhance logic-building and crack unexpected questions.

❓ Ask "why" it works – Don’t memorize. Understand deeply.

📅 Be consistent – A little every day beats cramming before exams. Turn learning into a habit.

📌 “Fail fast, learn faster.” Every bug, every wrong output—it’s all part of the journey. Keep experimenting.
